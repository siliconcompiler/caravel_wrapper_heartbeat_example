# Example 'heartbeat' Caravel Wrapper Installation

This repository contains the results of a SiliconCompiler run which integrates a minimal design into the Caravel wrapper.

Currently, this repository only contains the final GDS/Netlist results. Until we finalize the build process and update it to work with an upcoming release, the source files and build scripts can be found in the 'caravel\_wrapper\_test' branch of the SiliconCompiler repository.
